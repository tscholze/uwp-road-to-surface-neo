# Road to Surface Duo Xamarin App (#rTsd)
> This is a work in progress [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) project which is intended to feature most of the new features that makes the upcoming [Microsoft Surface Neo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-neo) unique. It will use the awesome German [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de)  as data source for its articles.

## tl;dr
This is neither an offical Dr. Windows app nor anything other than a highly motivated playground to dive deep into the modern UWP app ecosystem with a dedicated usecase in mind.
This project is written and owned by a beginner and meant for beginners. It would be perfect if experts could mentor the project - but this is just a mind in the clouds.

If you are looking for the siblings app that's based on Xamarin.Forms to work with the Sutface Duo, please see the GitHub repository [tscholze/xamarin-road-to-surface-duo](https://github.com/tscholze/xamarin-road-to-surface-duo).

## Prerequirements
- Windows 10
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Installed UWP Visual Studio plugins

## Other programms I used
- Microsoft [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) as information storage around the idea of the app
- Microsoft [Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) to clarify open question with the Dr. Windows team
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all, except source code editing, writings like mark down files
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Git operations outside of Visual Studio

## Features
- Good looking, hopefully (in my opinion)
- Utilizes Surface Neo features
- Lists articles of [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de) 
- Lists videos of [Dr. Windows Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrWindowsTV)
- Detail article view
- Share functionality

## Caution
Due to the early days of the Surface Neo, there is no emulator or a SDK. I try to update this project with new features until it is actual runable.

## Keep in mind
This app is purely build for having fun! All features have room for improvements or could be done more elegant.
