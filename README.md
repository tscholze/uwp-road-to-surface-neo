# Road to Surface Duo Xamarin App (#rTsd)
> This is a work in progress [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) project which is intended to feature most of the new features that makes the upcoming [Microsoft Surface Neo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-neo) unique. It will use the awesome German [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de)  as data source for its articles.

## Caution
Due to the early days of the Surface Neo, there is no emulator or a SDK. I try to update this project with new features until it is actual runable.
